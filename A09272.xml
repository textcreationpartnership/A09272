            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Now the Scriptures are opened to us, not onely by the publicke preaching of the Word, but, in its kinde and place, alſo by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Commentaries of the Learned; whoſe pens and hands are, I doubt not, guided by a ſweete influence of the providence of God, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of his holy Spirit: this difference being ever obſerved, That the Writers of the Scripture were ſo<note n="i" place="margin">2.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Doctrinall,</hi> as the firſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. to the ſeventh Verſe, being a Sermon of Repentance, prefixed as a Preface to the other Propheſies both of Mercies and Iudgements: and that fitly; Repentance being the onely preparative to fit a People to heare of Mercie, and an onely meanes to eſcape Iudgement. In this Sermon we are to note,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Circumſtances, which are three, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1. The Time <hi>[In the eight moneth]</hi> two moneths after Haggai began to propheſie, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.1. when as the Iewes were in ill ſtate through Famine, and the worke of the Temple but newly taken in hand. <hi>[of the ſecond yeere of Darius]</hi> There was no King in Iſrael, from whoſe reigne to date their Propheſies: And who this King of Perſia was, Whether Darius the ſonne of Hyſtaſpis, or Nothus, wee'le leaue to enquire, til we come to the twelfth verſe of this Chapter.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>3. The Perſon, by whoſe Miniſterie the Meſſage is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: deſcribed unto us by his Name, Pedigree, and Office <hi>[unto Zechariah, the ſonne of Berechiah, the ſonne of Iddo, the Prophet]</hi> that <hi>[the Prophet]</hi> is to be referred to Zechariah, not to Iddo: Though there were one of that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14708:6"/>name a Prophet; yet that Zechariah was of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie, is utterly uncertaine. This Zechariah is the ſame that is mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.51. who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1, 13.</note> the re-edifying of the Temple, was ſlaine by the Iewes: Nor needes any long diſpute about it, ſeeing both the name of his Father is the ſame, Berechiah, here and in <hi>Matthew.</hi> And alſo the manner of Chriſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count eaſily perſwades to it: who reckoning up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud ſhed by the Iewes, begins at <hi>Abel,</hi> and ends even in the laſt of the holy Prophets. Whereas after that Zechariah, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.22. many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and holy men were put to death. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, What warrant is there, to turne Iehoiadas name into Berechiah? Is it likely he was <hi>trinominis,</hi> Iehoiada, Berechiah, and Iohanan? for ſo he is called in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the High Prieſts, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.9. Or what ground is there, to<note n="*" place="margin">Genev. Note on 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.22.</note> ſay Zacharies progenitors were Iddo, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rechiah, Iehoiada, &amp;c. when no ſuch thing appeares in Genealogie? Beſides, it is not unlikely, that that Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in the ſecond of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> was ſlaine in the Court of the People, after hee had preached unto them, ſtanding in an high place among them, as appeares <hi>Verſe</hi> 20, 21. but this was ſlaine in the Court of the Prieſts, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Temple and Altar: whither, being aſſaulted, hee ran for ſanctuarie, as others before him had done, though they were no Prieſts, as it may be our Zacharie was not. Some thinke, it was Zacharie the Father of Iohn Baptiſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. that Chriſt ſpeakes of; but it is without all ground of good reaſon: and therefore I reſt on the firſt, as a truth.</item>

               <list>
                  <item>1. From Gods fierce anger againſt their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers: <hi>[The Lord hath beene diſpleaſed]</hi> not in an ordinarie manner, but <hi>[ſore diſpleaſed]</hi>

                  <item>2. From Gods ſoveraigntie and high power to command, or puniſh: <hi>[Thus ſayth the Lord of Hoſtes]</hi> and againe, <hi>[Thus ſayth the Lord of Hoſtes]</hi> againſt whom there is no hope to rebell, and proſper, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3.</item>
                  <item>3. From Gods promiſe of mercie upon their repentance: <hi>[I will turne unto you]</hi> in pardon of ſinne, and deliverie of them out of the ſcarcitie and dangerous condition they were then in, into a better eſtate of peace and plentie, and outward proſperitie. This promiſe alſo is ſtrengthened by the former attribute of Gods power <hi>[ſayth the Lord of Hoſtes]</hi> who have command over Man, and all other Creatures, to make your Enemies at peace with you, or to defend you from their force, and to cauſe the Earth to be fruitfull for your neceſsities, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. Amplified, by a Removall of one maine impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this peoples repentance; and that is, The bad example of their fore-fathers, and their good opinion of them: A point prevailing much with all, but very much with the Iewes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.21.</note> who were great admirers and ſtiffe imitators of their Ancientrie. From this the Prophet dehorts them, <hi>[Be not as your Fathers]</hi> No? Why not? The Prophet gives two reaſons, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to the contrarie.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From their Diſobedience. Your Fathers were not ſo honeſt men as you may deeme them to be; they were Rebels: Which appeares by
<list>
                        <item>1. The preachings of the Prophets in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, convincing them of their wicked courſes, and calling upon them for repentance. <hi>[unto whom the former Prophets]</hi> as wee now to

                        </item>
                        <item>2.

                  </item>
                  <item>2. From their Puniſhment: Which is here more largely amplified, as an enforcement of the firſt reaſon of the Prophets exhortation to repentance; <hi>viz.</hi> The Fathers were puniſhed, therefore the Children ſhall not goe ſcot-free. This the Prophet doth elegantly, preventing that Opinion which deepely poſſeſſeth the mindes of impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> That Gods Iudgements in former times, and his Miniſters preaching to ages paſt, doe not a whit concerne poſteritie; that which is paſt, is gone, and no more to be heeded. This hee refuteth,
<list>
                        <item>1. By a Conceſsion in part: that it is true, their Fathers were but men, and dead they are, nor can they now tell us how it fared with them. <hi>[Your Fathers where are they?] id est,</hi> they are not. And for the Prophets themſelves, they were no more than men, and cannot live alwayes to teach and preach, or to ſee that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which they propheſie of. <hi>[And doe the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14708:7"/>Prophets live for ever?]</hi> They doe not: or, Shall the Prophets live for ever? [<gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>] Zachariah including himſelfe, and others then living in the ſame condition, with the former Prophets; and, if <hi>Sanctius</hi> be not deceived, ſecretly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the defect of Propheſie ſhortly to enſue in the Iewiſh eſtate. Some expound this Verſe Dialogue-wiſe; as if the latter queſtion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Prophets, were made by the People in anſwere of Gods queſtion touching their Fathers. But ſo, the ſenſe and connexion of this Verſe with thoſe following, is obſcured; as it is likewiſe, if it be interpreted of the falſe Prophets. The former ſenſe is cleare, and drives at this, That the power of Gods Word depends not on any mens perſons, nor is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any one age, <hi>Verſe</hi> 5.</item>
                        <item>2. By a vehement Inſtance and Oppoſition. Your Fathers are dead, yet their puniſhments are not to be forgotten: and the Prophets are dead too, but the truth of their Propheſies was not buried with them; but was in every point fulfilled, according to their preaching. Which appeares,

All which being, as it ſeemes, ſhewen unto Zacharie ſucceſsively, without interruption, were likewiſe declared unto the people in one Sermon. Wherein, as in the former, wee have,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Viſion</hi> 1. The ſcope of this Viſion, is to let the Iewes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the providence and care which God had of them in this their miſerable eſtate, when God ſeemed to neglect and caſt them off. Here we are to note,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Deſcription of the Viſion, <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>[I ſaw by Night]</hi> I had a Viſion in the Night; a time fit, and uſuall for ſuch revelations: <hi>[and behold a Man riding]</hi> an Angell in mans ſhape; even Chriſt, the Captaine of the Lords Hoſt, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 4.14. and formoſt of the Troupe; in likeneſſe of an Horſeman, readie appointed to make out for his peoples good: The ſame, that <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13.21. is called Michael, Prince of the Iewes. <hi>[Vpon a Red Horſe:]</hi> Why Red?

Interpreters conceive in the Myrtles a Type of the Church, and the godly that were left among the Iewes, of whom God had a care, <hi>ſed quaere. [Bottome]</hi>

Not that God, without them, is eyther ignorant, or weake; but it ſerves for the honour of his Majeſtie, and comfort of our infirmitie, that hee have ſuch Miniſters. Hereby hee teacheth the Iewes, that God was not idle, nor they forgotten; but that his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14708:9"/>providence was awake, and working for the Churches good. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. After that Chriſt hath thus ſhewed what Office theſe his Attendants had, let us heare in the fourth place,</p>

               <p>But this account of the Ieſuites carryes little ſhew of good reaſon with it: For, firſt, they begin the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie at the firſt of Nebuchadnezzar, and the third of Iehoiakim, when the Citie was firſt taken, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. which ought with much better reaſon begin at the eight yeere of Nebuchadnezzar, when Iechoniah was carryed away captive: or<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>W.R.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14708:11"/>out farre amiſſe. Thirdly, they take it for granted, that Darius, here ſpoken of in Zacharie, was the ſonne of Hyſtaſpis; which is very doubtfull: for, firſt, How ſhall the order of ſo many Kings be ſalved up, who are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned betweene the time of Cyrus and Darius, in whoſe time the Temple was finiſhed? which Catalogue we have, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. Secondly, What ſhall be ſaid to the Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. who affirme the Temple was 46. yeeres in building? ſpeaking of this Temple, not of Herods, which was but 10. yeeres in trimming, <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> 15. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. c.</hi> 14. Now betweene their deliverie, the firſt of Cyrus, to the finiſhing of this Temple, the ſixt of Darius Hyſtaſpis, is but 16. or 17. yeeres. Shall we ſay boldly as Ribera doth, that the Iewes eyther told a lye of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or ſpake like ignorant fooles?</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, if wee take the account of Iunius, Helvicus, &amp;c. who thinke, Zacharie propheſied in the ſecond of Darius Nothus, the difficultie is as great, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſolation had continued at that time not 70. yeeres onely, but even 180. yeeres. Now there are preſumptions and probabilities againſt this alſo, that the time of this Propheſie was not in Nothus reigne. Firſt, it ſeemes not likely, that the Temple ſhould remaine unbuilt, and the Citie unrepayred, for ſo long a time as 108. yeeres after the peoples returne home: Strange, that there was never a Prophet to admoniſh them: that Zerubbabel and Iehoſhua would for all that time be ſo careleſſe, and that the continuall Plague of Famine and Penurie would not quicken them to their dutie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Nehemiah, 33. yeeres after the propheſying of Zacharie and Haggaie, comes to Ieruſalem, in the 20. yeere of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> and then hee findes, <hi>Neb.</hi> 7.4. that the Citie was large and great, the People in it few, and the<note n="*" place="margin">And yet Haggaie complaines of their too much forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in brave Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.4, 9.</note> Houſes not builded. A very ſtrange matter, that in the compaſſe of an 140. yeeres after their returne, the Iewes, being at their returne<note n="*" place="margin">

Which is further manifeſted by <hi>Neh.</hi> 11.1. where, by reaſon of the ſcarcitie of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the Tenth of the people were taken out of the Townes and Villages about, to dwell in Ieruſalem.

Which came to paſſe, by reaſon of the ungratefull ſlackneſſe of the greateſt part of the Iewes; who refuſing the benefit of their deliverance, choſe rather to remaine at eaſe in Babylon: ſo that of great multitudes, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene fortie and fiftie thouſand returned: A poore number, to repleniſh a large Countrey, and great Cities, which in the time of the Captivitie had beene utterly waſted and over-run at pleaſure by all the neighbouring Nations.

I dare ſay of this Relation, that it is a lowd Lye, as many other in the ſame Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are; no way agreeable eyther to Scripture, or likelyhood of reaſon. Who can beleeve, that the

Had not an Armie of almoſt five Millions of men beene able both to over-run the Babylonians, and all parts of the Eaſterne World beſides, and alſo to re-people not onely two no very great Provinces, Iuda and Benjamin, but even all from Dan to Beerſheba, had the countrey of Canaan beene as bigge againe as it was? and why then doth Nehemiah after this time complaine, <hi>chap</hi> 4. that the Citie was naked of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and tells us, that they gave thankes to ſuch as upon the Tithing were willing to dwell in Ieruſalem the Head Citie, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.2.

Now among many other diſcouragements this people had, this their thinne and ſmall number, joyned with the deſolation and waſtneſſe of the countrey, was a maine cauſe to quaile their courage, and daſh their forwardneſſe in building the Temple, or anie other publike enterpriſe. Wherefore in theſe words God promiſeth, that there ſhall be ſuch increaſe both of men and cattell, as not only Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and wailed Cities; but villages and unwalled townes ſhall be repleniſhed with them.

Therefore underſtand it, as the reaſon following enforceth, of ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Men and Cattell, as they ſhould ſpread over the whole Countrey, and inhabite as well the Villages as the walled Townes, though now they lay unfrequented and deſolate, as they did, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.7. and doe alwayes, in times of Warre and common Danger <hi>[for the multitude of Men and Cattell therein]</hi> which muſt have more roome, &amp;c.

Stories ſhew unto us, That in the 500. yeeres paſſing betweene their returne from Captivitie, and their finall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, the Iewes did grow both a populous and potent People; ſuch as were mightily defended from the extreme rage of all neighbouring Nations, eſpecially the Oppreſſion of the Kings of Syria and Egypt; and among whom, the Worſhip of God and true Religion being eſtabliſhed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the re-building of a beautifull Temple, made the Iewes truly honourable and renowned.</p>

Thirdly, their Vnbeliefe, and Opinion, that things were now in ſo ill a caſe, that they could not be ſet to rights. For Propheſies and Promiſes, they tooke no great heed to them: It was 70. yeeres agoe; all was loſt; the Countrey lay deſolate; the Nations about, were their bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and would plot all miſchiefe againſt them: and therefore they would even ſit ſtill, and ſee what would become of thoſe that were ſo venturous, to returne.

Whoſe companie ſoever they wanted, and how naked ſoever the Cities were of inhabitants, yet God would dwell amongſt them; whoſe preſence and favour would countervaile all other ſcarcities and inconveniences. <hi>[For loe, I come, and I will dwell in the middest of thee, ſayth the Lord.]</hi> Hee had forſaken them, and was as a ſtranger that paſſed by, or lodged among them but for a Night; but now he would returne, and be as an inhabitant and dweller amongſt them. But how, and when was this fulfilled? I anſwere: It was fulfilled partly preſently, partly in time ſucceeding. Preſently, upon the building of the Temple, the Houſe of Gods dwelling; and the re-eſtabliſhment of his Worſhip, the manner of his entertainment. For, although this Temple wanted both the Arke and the<note n="*" place="margin">

But much more was this fulfilled, when, in the fulneſſe of time, the Sonne of God taking Fleſh, dwelt amongſt Men, and for 33. yeeres ſpace graced this People with his bodily preſence. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10.</item>
                  <item>2. From the aſſociation of Forreiners unto the Church of the Iewes. Their Eſtate and Religion ſhould ſo flouriſh, that many of the Nations round about ſhould be wonne over, to joyne with them. <hi>[And many Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord in that Day]</hi> In what Day? Whether the time before Chriſts Death, or that afterward; when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-Wall being broken downe, the Gentiles were admitted to the Societie of the Church? Of the former time, there is no doubt, but that, after the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14708:20"/>eſtabliſhing of all things, untill Chriſts Death, the number of Proſelytes, out of divers Nations, was not ſmall; both for that by reaſon of the many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions of the Iewes, and commerce with other Nations, their Cuſtomes and Religion was more commonly knowne; and becauſe theſe Times were to be as a Preparative to the generall Calling of the Gentiles. We ſee, that upon the good eſcape of the Iewes in Babylon,<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſt.</hi> 8.17.</note> many turned to their Religion; and the Stories of the Evangeliſts, and<note n="*" place="margin">

If we underſtand it of the generall Converſion of the Gentiles to the Goſpell, it may be demanded, How this could make for the comfort of the Iewes now, who were alwayes ſtiffe in the maintenance of Moyſes Ceremonies; all which, with the Temple and State, were to be taken away at the Gentiles Converſion? <hi>Ergo Quaere.

Secondly, God will have his poſſeſſion lye not in Babylon, or other forreine Lands of their Captivitie, but in Canaan, the Holy Land, the ancient Seat of their Fathers, and of his holy Worſhip, <hi>[and ſhall chuſe Ieruſalem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine]</hi> therein to eſtabliſh his Service and Worſhip, after hee hath ſo long time ſeemed to reject it. <hi>Verſe</hi> 12.</item>

Againſt theſe, God gives the Iewes comfort by this Viſion; namely, That although their ſinnes might be objected againſt themſelves and their Interceſſor, the High Prieſt; yet they had another High Prieſt, who would pleade their Cauſe, pardon their Sinnes, build up the Temple, and give Peace to his Church. This Viſion hath two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the Type; Iehoſhua, the Iewiſh High Prieſt: againſt whom principally, Satan bends his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, as that Perſon who ſtood betweene God and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14708:22"/>the People, to make interceſsion and attonement for them; though alſo, through his ſide, he ſtrike at the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all the Church. In this part therefore we have to conſider,</p>

Such is Satans malice and impudencie, to hurt and hinder us moſt in our beſt imployments, and to accuſe the Saints even to their beſt Friend, Chriſt Ieſus: For hee is here meant, by the Angell of the Lord; not any inferiour Angell, deputed as a Iudge in this Buſineſſe, as ſome need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely imagine.</p>

And, as filthie, ſtinking, rotten Ragges make the companie of one man loathſome to another; ſo Satan hoped to render Ioſhua and his Office abhominable before Chriſt. Notwithſtanding yet, that he was ſo ill clad, we may ſee that <hi>[He ſtood before the Angel]</hi> Chriſt did not abhorre his preſence, nor reject his ſervice: ſo gracious is hee to reſpect his Saints, notwithſtanding their many infirmities; and to accept their obedience, though mingled and ſtayned with much corruption.

And in the 18. Verſe of the 10. Chapter it is plaine enough, that the ſonnes of Iehoſhua had married ſtrange Wives: A fault in the father, to ſuffer them; if not much more a fault, that hee himſelfe had one: which, as Ierome ſayth, is the opinion of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.

A Viſion needfull for the Comfort of this poore People, whoſe Weakeneſſes and Dangers were ſo great, that it made them doubt, how it was poſsible for their State ever to be reſtored; or if reſtored, how it ſhould be defended. Wherefore, in this moſt heavenly Revelation, God makes it appeare to the Prophet, and by him, to the People, That it is not Iehoſhua's nor Zerubbabels, nor all their ſtrength, which muſt reare up the Building of his Church and Temple; and, that it is not the force of any Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie which ſhall hinder it. Gods gracious Power would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this Worke, by the weakeſt Meanes, againſt the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Reſiſtance.

Theſe two Pipes Sanctius leaves out, in his deſcription of this Candleſticke: and ſo, by miſtaking here, and before, by adding one Lampe more to the ſeven, quite darkens the Light and cleare declaration of this Viſion; as may be ſeene by his Explication and Type or Patterne he maketh of the Candleſticke.

Not to reckon up the divers Conjectures of Interpreters, touching the Scope of this Viſion; that which I take to be moſt plaine, and directly intended, is, The extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and finall diſperſion of the Iewes out of their owne Land, when the Meaſure of their Iniquities and Rebellions ſhould come to the full. The former, threatened Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to particular Perſons; this, to the whole State. The Viſion is obſcure and darke: yet all Circumſtances ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that appeares to be the drift of it.

Wherefore take wee it in the ordinarie ſignification, for Wickedneſſe, Impietie, Sinfulneſſe; and then, this Woman is a Figure of the whole ſinfull Nation of the Iewes; whom God would puniſh, for their extreame Impieties and Corruptions.

               <p n="4">4. Of two Women, which carryed away the Ephah with the Woman in it, and Talent upon it. Now, this fourth part of the Viſion declares what manner of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment God would lay upon this People; which is no leſſe, than their finall diſperſion, and ſcattering abroad from their owne Land; figured, by this carrying away of the Ephah into the Land of Shinar. Which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Inſtruments that conveyed it away, two winged Women: <hi>[Then I lift up mine eyes, and looked, and behold, there came out two Women,]</hi> that is, ſayth Iunius, the Church of the Iewes, in reſpect of two ſeverall Times; firſt, under Ezra, who purged and reformed the Church, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. ſecondly, under Nehemiah, who againe reformed the abuſes thereof, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. So, that in effect, the two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men heere, are Ezra and Nehemiah, the principall authors of Reformation, though they uſed the helpe alſo of the other Rulers. But, <hi>pace tanti viri,</hi> this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſeemes not allowable: Firſt, for that theſe were times of Reformation, wherein wee finde none throwne out of the Church, but upon Repentance and preſent amendment of that generall fault, <hi>viz.</hi> Marriage of ſtrange Wives, more firmely united thereto. But this Viſion ſeemes not to intimate any generall Reformation of Wickedneſſe, but a generall Puniſhment, for default of Repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as appeares by the order of the Viſion: the wicked Woman is caſt into the Ephah, covered with Lead, then carried away into another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Secondly, it ſtands not with the laſt Verſe; which moſt clearely ſhewes, that this wicked Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould beare the puniſhment of her Iniquitie, not at home in Iudaea, but in perpetuall Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in forraine Countreyes. And Iunius interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14708:39"/>of this Baniſhment into Shinar, (to be the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging and enwrapping of the wicked Iewes at home, in the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">If by the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he mean Perpetuall, it is true in ſome ſort, albeit thoſe in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon were not baniſhed as yet from the Iews Societie, but might returne home, if they would; yea, did once a yeere ordinarily come up to Ieruſalem.</note> Condemnation with their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Brethren, reſiding in Babylon) is intricate, and falls ſhort of the full meaning of that Verſe, as wee ſhall ſee. Wherefore I conceive, that by theſe two Women is meant nothing elſe, but thoſe Inſtruments and Agents whom God would imploy in the ſpeedie execution of his Wrath upon the Iewiſh Nation; who are reſembled by Women: not for that God would bring it to paſſe by weake meanes (for that is not ſo, the Romans by ſtrong hand overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iewes Common-wealth) but onely to keepe proportion with the reſt of the Viſion, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties puniſhing might be correſpondent to the partie puniſhed: ſhee appeared like a Woman, and ſo did they. [<hi>And the wind was in their</hi>

                  <hi>wings, for they had wings like the wings of a Storke.</hi>] This figures the ſwift and violent execution of Gods Iudgement on this Nation. The Women had wings, and thoſe large and great, like the wings of a Storke; and they were helped forward with the winde, which bore them up, and drove them on apace, like a Bird that flyes before the winde. All which ſets foorth the ſwift approach and ſpeedie execution of Gods Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to be accompliſhed by the Romans, who with great celeritie and violence deſtroyed the Iewes State. Iunius and Piſcat. underſtand it of the ſwift and couragious proceeding of Ezra and Nehemiah againſt the Corruptions and Abuſes of their Times: And true it is, that firſt Reformation was ſpeedily performed, within the ſpace of two moneths, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.16, 17. But I take the ſcope of the Viſion lookes not that way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Manner of it: They tooke up the Ephah from the ground, and lifting it aloft in the Ayre, carryed it away betwixt them. <hi>[And they lift up
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14708:39"/>the Ephah betweene the Earth and the Heaven,] id est,</hi> ſay Iunius and Piſcat. by the Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication publiquely denounced, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.8. for to that place, I ſuppoſe, they have reference. But, I take it, this lifting up betweene the Earth and Heaven, is onely a meere circumſtance of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the Ephah. The Women that beare it away, had wings, and flye they did; wherefore it was neceſſarie they ſhould take up the Ephah, and mount with it aloft into the Ayre. That which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in it, is the manner of this Puniſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> it ſhould be a removall and deportation of them out of their owne Countrey. Which further appeares by the next Circumſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Place whither this Ephah was carried, and where it was left: Which, by occaſion of the Prophets Queſtion, <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. the Angell tells, <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. <hi>[And he ſaid unto me, To build it an Houſe] id eſt,</hi> to appoint it a place of continuall abode,<note place="margin">

For, although the Iewes were by the Romans ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into all parts of the World almoſt, yet they did and doe principally reſide in thoſe Eaſterne parts of<note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.</note> Aſia the leſſe, Chaldaea, Meſopotamia, and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.

And it is moſt probable, the remaining of thoſe Iewes in Babylon, was a great occaſion to draw thither a great number of theſe ſcattered Iewes; who,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14708:40"/>upon their flight and diſperſion, reſorted thither for entertainment, <hi>[and it ſhall be eſtabliſhed and ſet there upon her owne Baſe.]</hi> This ſignifies the perpetuitie and firme continuance of the Iewes Puniſhment: This wicked Woman had beene before carried Captive, but it was but for 70. yeeres: ſhee ſhould yet againe be carried away out of her owne Countrey, and be ſurely ſettled to abide for ever in the Land of her Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; like as a Houſe upon its Foundation, or Pillar, ſtrongly fixed upon a firme<note n="*" place="margin">

Thus then, theſe wicked Iewes being compaſſed in with their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and impriſoned under the heavie Burthen of Gods dreadfull Vengeance, ſhould by the inſtruments of Gods Iuſtice be driven out of their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and made to beare the puniſhment of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in forraine Countreyes, whither they ſhould be baniſhed, from generation to generation: as wee ſee it fulfilled to this day, ſince their firſt overthrow of their State by T.

                  <hi>Viſion</hi> 7. TOuching the Scope of this Viſion, there are two Opinions of Interpreters. The firſt is, of thoſe who underſtand by theſe foure Chariots the foure Empires, with relation to the Church of God; whoſe Beginning and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, Actions and Succeſſions, were from time to time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Gods ſupreame Will and Providence: So, that whatſoever his Church and People had, or ſhould ſuffer under them, was fore-ſeene and fore-appointed by God himſelfe. And as in Daniel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. after the Viſion of the foure Monarchies, Chriſts eternall and ſpirituall Kingdome is preſently deſcribed, which ſhould bee more large and laſting than any of the former; ſo likewiſe is it in this place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, of thoſe who by theſe Chariots underſtand the Angels, who are ſpeedie Miniſters of Gods manifold Decrees: Which provident government of God, by the Miniſterie of his Angels, is here declared for the comfort both of the Iewes that were returned, and of thoſe that yet abode in Babylon; whoſe caſe was not yet ſo deſperate, but that God had amongſt them a Remnant, of whom he tooke care, to ſave them by his Grace and Mercie. An effect of which care of God towards them, is afterwards ſet downe by an Example, of the Converſion of ſome of them: Vpon whoſe comming to Ieruſalem, to Offer their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, occaſion is taken, by a viſible Ceremonie and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to confirme their Faith, and the Faith of the reſt of the Iewes, in the Promiſe of the Meſſias, and his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Which of theſe Opinions to take to, or whether we may reſt on eyther of them, I cannot ſay, nor dare define: both have their probabilities, and neyther of them much more, for ought I ſee. I thinke we muſt be content to be ignorant of the thorow meaning of this Viſion: I will relate what others thinke, and ſo proceed. We have here then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Deſcription of the Viſion:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Generally: <hi>[I turned and lift up mine eyes, and looked, and behold, there came foure Charets,]</hi> not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14708:41"/>without their Drivers, though they be not named, <hi>[out from betweene two Mountaines,]</hi> Alluſion to the cuſtome of thoſe Times, of running Races with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, where the Horſes and Charets ſtood readie for the Courſe, incloſed within the Carceres, or barred Liſts, from whence, upon the ſigne given, they looſed, <hi>[and the Mountaines were Mountaines of Braſſe.]</hi> By theſe Brazen Mountaines, all underſtand, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Decrees and Councels; which, as they are moſt firme and immutable in themſelves, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removable Mountaines of Braſſe, or Steele, ſo are they the Beginnings of all Actions and Effects in the World. And therefore theſe Charets are ſayd to come foorth from betweene theſe Mountaines, Gods Providence appointing them their courſe. <hi>Verſe</hi> 1.</item>
                  <item>2. Particularly: deſcribing by what Horſes every Charet was drawne, <hi>Verſe</hi> 2, 3. <hi>[In the firſt Charet were red Horſes, and in the ſecond Charet blacke Horſes, and in the third Charet white Horſes, in the fourth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret grizled and Bay Horſes.]</hi> They that thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the foure Monarchies, are much troubled in the interpretation and application of theſe ſeverall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Some ridiculouſly take it for ſuch Colours as thoſe Nations moſt of all uſed; as the Chaldaeans, Red, &amp;c. Others, with reference to the Iewiſh eſtate, for Types of that dealing which they uſed towards the Iewes: as the Chaldaeans, Red, becauſe they were bloudie; the Medes and Perſians, Blacke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe under them it was a ſorrowfull time to the Iewes, by reaſon of their Captivitie; and the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, White, becauſe the Iewes were well handled by them; as by Alexander, at his comming to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: the Romans, grizled, or of divers Colours; becauſe, of their Emperours, ſome uſed the Iewes well, and gently; ſome ill, and cruelly. But theſe are Conceits, not onely frivolous, but falſe, if they bee thorowly ſcanned. And bee it ſo, that by the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14708:42"/>Charets are meant theſe Monarchies, yet it will be too much preſumption, without the helpe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels interpretation, to give a reaſon of theſe Colours, which haply were onely for diſtinction ſake, to know one Charet from another, without further ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The Bay and Grizled drew both together in the fourth Charet, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Romans; now they are ſevered: the Grizled goe towards the South; the Bay, thorowout all the Earth. Wherefore eyther wee muſt ſay, that by the Bay and Grizled is onely meant the Romans, who ſhould not onely overcome the Graecian Empire, as it is <hi>verſe</hi> 6. but alſo ſhould extend their Dominion to all places of the World beſides, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. Or elſe wee muſt take theſe Bay Horſes for ſome other Kingdome, which having ſometime beene a part of the Roman Empire, ſhould afterward over-runne the whole World. Ribera re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the former, becauſe the Romans had conquered all the World, before the ſubduing of Aegypt; as appeares by Storie, and Auguſtus Taxation, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. Wherefore, what need they, after that their going into the South Countrey, to deſire to goe over all the Earth? Therefore he underſtands by them, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdome. But what? The Gothes, Vandals, and Northerne Nations, who being firſt ſubjects to the Romans, and part, as of their Empire, ſo of their<note n="*" place="margin">Oroſ. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> Armies, afterward rebelled, divided themſelves from the Romans, and by many Eruptions <hi>[ſought to goe]</hi> and get abroad, which yet were a long time hindered by the Romans: yet afterward they had leave from God, <hi>[and he ſaid, Get yee hence, &amp;c.]</hi> and, <hi>[So they walked to and fro thorow the Earth,]</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:14708:43"/>over-ranne the whole World, ſcarce any Countrey being free from their invaſion and tyrannie. To this interpretation of Ribera, Sanctius ſubſcribes: but Spaniard-like, out of admiration of his owne Nation, addes a ridiculous Conceit of his owne, That <hi>non longe erraret ab optima conjectura, qui crederet hanc Prophetiam ad Hiſpanos quoque pertinere;</hi> who being deſcended of the Gothes, have ſpread their Armes and Fame farre and wide thorow the World. Iunius, and thoſe that interprete this Viſion of the Angels, underſtand no more but this, That theſe Angels are appointed to ſeverall Countreyes: the ſecond and third Charet ſent to Babylon, to take care of the Iewes reſiding there; the fourth ſent into the South Countrey, <hi>id eſt,</hi> into Iudaea, to over-ſee thoſe Iewes that were returned, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. and all of them being [<hi>confirmati</hi>

Now, touching the Courſes of theſe Charets, here is yet one doubt, Why there is mention made of the firſt Charet, wherein the Red Horſes were. Ribera ſayth, it was becauſe the Chaldaean Empire was at this time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and ſo their Race was runne. Wherefore the Angell ſpeakes nothing of them.

In this Storie is ſet foorth an Effect of that Care, in an Example of ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts; who, as Embaſſadours from the reſt, come to Ieruſalem, to make publike profeſſion of their Faith, &amp; to Offer unto the Lord: unto whom God vouchſafeth this favor, to give them a viſible teſtimonie and confirmation of the promiſed Meſsias.</p>

Something there muſt be for the preſent comfort of the Iewes; and this is a promiſe of ayde in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Materiall Temple, which the Iewes at home ſhould receive from ſtrangers afarre off.

Not ſo much by the calling of the Gentiles and their aſſociation to the Church, which was a long time after this; and the Iewes, to whom Zacharie ſpeakes, lived not to ſee it, though Zacharie were alſo a true Prophet in that too: as in the preſent helpe they ſhould have

But it might hinder the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, and cauſe God to turne the hearts of men from favouring and forwarding this worke: as already it had done a good while, and might have done longer, upon their obſtinacie and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Word of God, delivered by Haggai and Zachary. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15.</item>

Here is then the ſumme of the Queſtion, Whether the Iewes, having by agreement among themſelves, for a long time obſerved a day of Faſting, in remembrance
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14708:52"/>of the Temples deſtruction, ought now, the Temple almoſt repaired and finiſhed, to lay down this cuſtom, or obſerve it ſtill? Concerning which Queſtion, we are to obſerve two things: 1. That whereas the Iewes obſerved foure dayes of faſting, in memory of their ruined State and Temple, they only propoſe the queſtion touching one, <hi>viz.</hi> That for the Temple. The Reaſon I gheſſe at, is, Becauſe the Temple onely was in greateſt forwardneſſe towards perfect reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but for the re-building of the City of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and re-collection of their diſperſion, they were things vnlikely to come to paſſe yet; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought that it was not amiſſe to faſt ſtill in that reſpect. The Prophet in his anſwer includes them all foure, there beeing the ſame reaſon of one as of another. 2. That whatſoever ſolemnitie or ſhew of Conſcience theſe uſed in the propoſall of this Queſtion, the Prophet ſeemes to ſleight them, as making much adoe about a trifle. And by his anſwer, we may plainely gather, that theſe Caſuiſts were in this matter guilty of a double fault: 1. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, ſending a ſerious Embaſſage about a neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Ceremonie, neglecting in the meane time the ſubſtance of Mercy and Piety. 2.<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap> ſaith Kimchi.</note> Incredulitie and Diſtruſt of the fulfilling of Gods Promiſes, touching the reſtoring of their Church and State: Which is apparant by their Practice; elſe why did they make any doubt to ſurceaſe faſting for the ruine of the Temple, if, when now they ſaw it before their eyes well nigh finiſhed, they had yet beleeved it would ſhortly haue beene fully repaired? Would not reaſon teach them, that it was vnreaſonable to faſt for the old, when they had a new; eſpecially their faſting beeing but a practice of their owne deuiſing? Againe, why were they ſilent of the other faſts, and touch onely vpon this? there's a Core in that. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, had they fully beleeved the Promiſes which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14708:52"/>God had made unto them, by the preaching of Haggai, Zacharie, and other Prophets before, they might have ſeene more cauſe of ioy, than of griefe at this time. Theſe things will more clearly appeare in the opening of the Prophets anſwer. Come wee (therefore in the third place to</p>

               <p n="2">2. The Subſtance and Matter of the Sermon: Which divides it ſelfe into two generall parts:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Preface unto the maine Anſwer it ſelfe: which is large, ſtretching it ſelfe to the 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the <hi>Chapter:</hi> the Prophet, even by the manner of his anſwering, teaching the People, that there were other things of greater moment to be looked unto, than their Ceremonious Faſtings. Of which hee diſcourſeth at large: of theſe but in a word or two. This Preface containeth excellent Matter, and that of two ſorts:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reprehenſion of their prepoſterous Courſe, in ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much upon their owne Inventions and outward Obſervations, but neglecting Gods Commandement, and their Obedience unto it. And this reacheth to the end of the ſeventh Chapter: wherein the Prophet diſcovereth the Hypocriſie of this People, who ſeemed to make a Conſcience of their owne Inſtitutions, but cared not for Gods Precepts; and who thought, that God would bee well pleaſed with ſuch outward Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14708:53"/>and Ceremonies, though his voyce was not obeyed. This Reproofe conſiſteth of two Branches:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A plaine Deniall, that their Faſts were eyther commanded by God, or acceptable to him. <hi>[When yee fasted and mourned in the fift]</hi> for the Reaſon before: <hi>[And in the ſeventh Moneth]</hi> for the ſlaughter of Gedaliah: Vpon whoſe death followed the utter diſperſion of the Remainder of the Iewes, into Egypt and other Parts, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 25.22. &amp;c. and <hi>Ieremie</hi> 41. <hi>[Even thoſe ſeventie yeares]</hi> during the time of the Captivitie, and ſince, untill this time <hi>[Did yee fast at all</hi>

                  <hi>unto me?]</hi> A vehement Interrogation, for a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Deniall, <hi>[Yee did not at all fast unto mee.]</hi> And this againe by an Emphaticall Repetition and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to their Conſciences; Did yee faſt to mee? <hi>[Even unto me?]</hi> No, yee did not. To whom then? to your ſelves. Which will appeare, if the meaning of this Phraſe <hi>[unto me]</hi> bee explaned. To faſt unto God hath a double Meaning: 1. Eyther for the Time, to obſerve ſuch a day of ſolemne humiliation, as Gods Commandement ſomewhere or other hath limited unto us. 2. Or for the Manner, (which is the principall) when wee obſerue a day of faſting by ſuch Exerciſes, with ſuch Affections, and for ſuch Ends, as Gods Word preſcribes unto us, albeit the time be of our owne appointment. Now theſe Faſts of the Iewes, were neyther for the one or other Vnto God. For neyther had God any where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to obſerve ſuch Dayes of Faſting, neyther did the Iewes obſerve them in that Manner, as ſuch times of Humiliation ſhould bee ſpent. They grieved for the Deſtruction of the Temple, they wept, and tooke on for the Ruine of their State, and ſighed under the burden of their preſent Miſerie: But all this was no occaſion eyther of Remembrance and Repentance for Sinnes paſt, or Amendement for after times, whereby to remoue Gods wrath that lay

                  </note> Such carnall and worldly Sorrow little pleaſed God: And therefore the Prophet tels them, they faſted not unto God, but unto themſelves: As their owne Authority without Gods Command had ſet up thoſe Faſts, ſo their owne Ends, not Gods, were aymed at in ſuch Exerciſes. The truth is, theſe Faſts (appointed by the Iewes upon ſuch ſingular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions) were in themſelves good and lawfull, had they beene obſerved as Exerciſes of Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: but as they kept them in ſatisfaction to their Carnall humours (going no further than the outward Ceremonie) they were not pleaſing unto Ged. <hi>Verſe</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>This the Prophet further proueth by Compariſon with the Contrary: You aymed at Gods glory in your Abſtinence, even as much as you did in your Eating and Drinking. But you did eate and drinke for your ſelues, when, and in what manner you liked beſt, for your owne health or pleaſure: ſo was your Faſting a Matter to giue your ſelues Contentment, without any further reſpect of Gods Glory, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of your owne Pietie. <hi>[And when yee did eate and drinke &amp;c.] Verſe</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A plaine Declaration of the Reaſon, why God cared not for their Faſtings, by ſhewing their neglect of that which was moſt commanded by God, and acceptable to him: and that is in one word, their Obedience to God. The neglect whereof is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Prophet, as he ſhewes it was not onely the Cauſe why now their Faſts were not commen da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but alſo the Occaſion that brought them to this courſe of Faſting, by ruining their State, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof they ſorrow; which they need not haue done, if they would haue obeyed the voyce of God. This brought them to Miſerie, and in it makes them more miſerable. The Prophet therefore touches them to the quicke, and opens their Vlcer of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14708:54"/>and Diſobedience, that were plaiſtered over with Ceremonious ſhewes of Faſtings and other pious Exerciſes. This he doth two waies:</p>

Neglect this, and all your Faſting is to no purpoſe. Which the Prophet further ſhewes, by a cloſe Compariſon of the preſent Eſtate of things, with the former times wherein thoſe Prophets lived. The Temple and Common-wealth then ſtood, and flouriſhed; but the People were wicked: Iuſtice and Religion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14708:54"/>were forſaken, except in ſhew and ceremonie: the Prophets cryed out againſt thoſe courſes, but there was no amendement. And therefore all is now brought to ruine, as you ſee before your eyes.

Inſomuch, that after the ſlaughter of Gedaliah, when all the remainder of the People, Man, Woman and Childe, fledde into Epypt, there was not a lew left in the Countrey.

The Naturals were within ſeventie yeares to returne, and God keeps the roome emptie all that while for them, and Forreiners deſired not their Countrey.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14708:60"/>whoſe hearts God touched, did repaire to Iudaea. See Chap. 2. v. 6. <hi>[And I will bring them, and they ſhall dwell in the midst of Ieruſalem]</hi> As without doubt they did, though not all, nor all at one time. In five hundred years, ſo long was the time between the Captivitie and Chriſt, many things might fall out which Propheſies ſpeake of, and Stories mention not.

               <p>Vnto theſe former Promiſes, the Prophet addes an earneſt Exhortation unto the People, not to be diſcouraged, but to take heart againſt all occaſions of diſtruſt and feare. Which Exhortation hee preſſeth with much variety and

We have it related, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.8. It was in the ſecond Moneth of the ſecond yeare of the Peoples returne from Captivitie; that is, in the ſecond yeare of Cyrus: From whence, unto the fourth of Darius Nothus, are one hundred and eight yeares. But what, were Haggai and Zachary Prophets then at that time? Sure they muſt now be of a great Age, about an hundred and forty years old, ſuppoſing them to bee about thirty at the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Foundation of the Temple: which by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14708:61"/>the terme of <hi>[yongue man]</hi> given to Zacharie, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4. ſeemes not likely. And where are all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in that long ſpace? or did they propheſie at the laying of the Foundation, and after for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight yeares hold their peace, during the time the People neglected the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? It cannot be thought. Sanctius therefore takes the laying of the Foundation of the Temple, not to be properly meant, but to bee underſtood, for the Continuation of the Worke, which had beene ſo long time interrupted, and then taken in hand againe. Which may ſeeme to bee a new beginning of the Worke; as <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.2. <hi>[They beganne to build]</hi> though they had begunne before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.8. And then the meaning of the words lye thus, <hi>[In the day that the Foundation of the Lords houſe was layd]</hi>

Now Zerubbabel and Iehoſhua beganne to goe in hand with the finiſhing of the Temple, the ſecond yeere of this Darius, upon the Propheſie of Haggai in the ſixt and ninth Moneth of that yeare, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.11. and of Zacharie in the eight Moneth of the ſame yeare, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.1. In the ninth Moneth of the ſecond yeere, it appeares that the Worke went forward: before which time they had beene plagued with Famine, and after that God bleſſed them with increaſe; as is plaine, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>verſes.</hi> From that ninth Moneth of the ſecond yeare, to the ninth Moneth of this fourth yeere, wherein Zachary now preached, was two whole yeeres: Wherein, as the Worke of the Temple ſtill went forward; ſo God ſtill continued his Bleſſings on them. And therefore Zacharie brings this as a Motive to perſwade the People to Faith and Obedience to his Words now, by two yeeres experience which they had had of the truth of his, and his Colleagues former Propheſies.

                  </note> and Chap 46.13. When the tenne Tribes were now carried captive. But, by his favour, this Exegeticall interpretation of this place ſounds harſhly, and not juſtifiable by theſe other places, if their times and other circumſtances
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14708:64"/>be compared with this. Ribera underſtands it of the generall Converſion of all the Iewes in the times of the Goſpel: but haply we need not goe ſo farre, if it may appeare, that not onely the two Tribes of Iuda and Beniamin, but alſo the tenne Tribes, returned home at this time. I ſay the tenne Tribes not wholly, nor yet the greateſt part: for ſo it is manifeſt they did not come backe againe; no, nor the two Tribes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: A great, if not the greateſt, part of whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Babylon, deſpiſing the benefit of their deliverance; as we have ſeene before: but yet both are rightly ſaid to returne, becauſe ſome of eyther did returne. And ſo that place, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.6. muſt bee taken of the Generalitie, and whole body of the ten Tribes, not preciſely, as if no remuant of them ſhould eſcape out of Captivitie, contrary to <hi>verſe</hi> 11. of that <hi>chapter.</hi> And a like example of the Iewes, that fledde into Egypt, to whom utter deſtruction is threatned, <hi>Ier.</hi> 42.16, 17. Yet a remnant did eſcape, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.28. The probabilities that perſwade the returne of ſome part of the tenne Tribes, are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Generalitie of Cyrus Proclamation, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. and of Artaxerxes after him, <hi>Ezra</hi> 17.13. who give permiſſion to all the Iewes in their Dominion to returne to Ieruſalem. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine this unto the Iewes of the two Tribes, there is no reaſon; no more than to thinke, that onely the two Tribes, and none of the tenne, make uſe of it. It was but about one hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares that the tenne were captived before the two: and that time was not ſo long as to make them forget all acquaintance one with another: and ſeventie yeares commerce was ſufficient to recover it, had it beene loſt, eſpecially conſidering how common afflictions doe ſtrangely beget love and acquaintance in men of the ſame Nation in forraine Countries. And though the two Tribes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14708:64"/>were carried captive into Babylon, and the tenne ſomewhat further North and Eaſt towards Media, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.6. yet it is apparant, that both the one and the other were diſperſed and mingled into all quarters of the Aſſyrian, and afterwards, Perſian Empire, even throughout an hundred twenty and ſeven Provinces, <hi>Esther</hi> 3.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.2.12. Now ſeventie years acquaintance, and the common burden of Captivitie, could not chooſe but draw many of the one as well as of the other, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the occaſion of a generall releaſe from thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the ſecond of <hi>Ezra,</hi> we finde the number of the whole Congregation, that returned, to bee 42360. beſides their attendants: but if we reckon up the particulars of Iuda and Benjamin, which are in that Chapter punctually ſet downe, we ſhall finde the ſumme amount but to 29974. ſo that there wants about 12000. of the full number. Which, ſay the Hebrew Doctors, were thoſe that came up out of the other tenne Tribes. As R. Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamo Iſaac relates on <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.64.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Scripture ſeemes plainely to ſignifie ſo much in divers places, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. <hi>per totum.</hi> Albeit the meaning of theſe and the like places bee controverted, and by many expounded of the Converſion of the Iewes unto Chriſtianitie, and not of the Vnion of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of the twelve Tribes, which, returning from Captivitie, grew into one of Church and State in Iewrie. <hi>Ergo quaere ult,</hi> of this their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, touching this Compellation of the houſe of Iuda and Iſrael, this is to bee noted. That before the Captivitie of the two Tribes, and whilſt the Kingdome of Iſrael ſtood; there were many that from time to time revolted unto Iuda
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14708:65"/>out of love of true Religion there maintained, or other reſpects; as appeares in the time of Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.13. to <hi>verſe</hi> 17. and of Aſa, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.9. and of Hezekiah, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.11.18. And theſe, mingling themſelees with the two Tribes, were with them carried Captive, and with them returned: And of theſe the Prophet may ſpeake <hi>[O houſe of Iſrael.] Sed quae penitus.</hi> Let us proceede. <hi>[So will I ſave you, and yee ſhall be a bleſsing]</hi> A forme to be uſed in bleſſing of others; as the like <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.11, 12. ſee <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.20, Now becauſe ſo great proſperity was not likely to befall them, the Prophet againe repeats his firſt and generall Exhortation to Beliefe and Courage: which he uſed, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>[Feare not]</hi> Caſt no doubts, miſtruſt not your own weakeneſſe, your Enemies ſtrength, &amp;c. <hi>[But let your hands be ſtrong]</hi> Goe on in the Worke, and bee confident of Gods ayde. <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. And this hee further aſſures them of, by that which is the third Amplification of this Promiſe of a proſperous Eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. By the Cauſe of their Proſperitie: Which ſprings not from themſelves, or others, but from Gods gracious purpoſe to doe good unto them. Which purpoſe and decree of his is conſtant and unchangeable: and therefore they may truſt to it.

               <p n="2">2. The Anſwer it ſelfe, which the Prophet makes to their Demand about Faſting, which hee briefly reſolves them of in few words. His Anſwer conſiſts of two parts:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 An Abbrogation of their Cuſtome of Faſting. <hi>[And the Word &amp;c. Thus &amp;c. The Faſt of the fourth Moneth]</hi> wherein a breach was made in the Wals of Ieruſalem, and ſo the Citie taken, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.3. <hi>[And the Fast of the fift, and the fast of the ſeventh]</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.3.5. <hi>[And the faſt of the tenth]</hi> wherein Ieruſalem was firſt belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guered, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.1. <hi>[Shall bee to the houſe of Iudah joy and gladneſſe]</hi> Times of inward rejoycing in ſtead of their inward mourning and ſorrow of heart, <hi>[And of cheerefull feaſts]</hi> in ſtead of outward faſtings and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meates and drinkes.</item>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:14708:66"/>
                  <item>2. An Injunction to obſerve that, which God moſt required, and they moſt neglected: <hi>[Therefore]</hi> Ye ſee how little God regards your Faſtings, tis not that hee lookes after: <hi>Therefore &amp;c.</hi> or the Particle <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> may here be rendred <hi>And, And love ye the Truth:</hi> or [as the French, <hi>Love then the Truth, the Truth</hi>] the ſubſtance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in Obedience to God, Charity to your Neighbour; and let goe theſe outward needleſſe Ceremonies <hi>[and Peace]</hi> This is an effect of the love of Truth: It was not their Faſtings, <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.27.</note> but their Piety and Mercie that would procure their Peace, and bring them favour from God, and redreſſe of their troubled and afflicted eſtate. It may be alſo that in this word the Prophet gives them a cloſe Caveat, not to bee contentious in maintaining of old unneceſſary Cuſtomes, but quietly to lay them down. <hi>Verſe</hi> 19.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Reſolution of their Queſtion being thus briefly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the Prophet further enlarges, and confirmes his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by a Reaſon drawn from the Times now approaching; wherein Ceremonies ſhould ceaſe, and Truth onely come in place; wherein the Gentiles ſhould bee converted to true Religion, and joyne themſelves with the Iewes, to make up one glorious Church: which ſhould be a cauſe of rejoycing to the Iewes. This is delivered with great Caution, the aboliſhing of Ceremonies beeing rather intimated than expreſſed; and the manner of the Gentiles Converſion ſet forth in ſuch wiſe, as the Iewes might take no offence at it. The Argument then to move the Iewes to rejoycing, is this, That their Eſtate, how ever now it appeared, ſhould bee ſo glorious and flouriſhing, as that the Gentiles, who now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed them, ſhould be wonne to embrace true Religion, and joyne themſelves in fellowſhip with the Iewes. Which was fulfilled partly before Chriſt, by the more uſuall and frequent acceſſe of Proſelytes than ever before; partly after Chriſts incarnation, by preaching of the Goſpel: which time is here principally ſpoken of. For the words, we have in them the Gentiles Converſion, deſcribed</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:14708:67"/>

                  </gap> Yet, or, yet further, as the French <hi>(Il adviendra en outre)</hi> as an Acceſſe to the Iewes happy reſtoring <hi>[that there ſhall come People, and the Inhabitants of many Cities]</hi> of the Gentiles, who ſhall come, <hi>i. e.</hi> be converted, and joyne themſelves to the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Particularly, by three ſpeciall Circumſtances:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Zeale and Charity of theſe Convers, who would not come alone, but draw others along in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them, to the worſhip of God. Which is lively expreſſed in a <hi>Mimeſis,</hi> or imitation of the invitations and encouragements they ſhould uſe one to another, <note place="margin">Heb. Eundo tamus.</note> 
                     <hi>[And the Inhabitants of one Citie ſhall goe to another, ſaying, Let us goe</hi> (and that) <hi>ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeeke the Lord of Hoſtes] i. e.</hi> To worſhip and ſerve the Lord, compriſed under one kind of Prayer; and to bee informed of the right way and meanes to worſhip God, meant by ſeeking of him. Now theſe that were ſo earneſt to have others go, were not backward themſelves, and willing to tarry behinde, but <hi>[I will goe alſo]</hi> Every one was as forward for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as zealous for another. A ſingular patterne of zealous Charitie, that neyther leaves others behinde, nor turnes others before it. <hi>Verſe</hi> 21.</item>
                  <item>2. The large Extent of this Converſion, <hi>[Yea many People, and ſtronge Nations]</hi> Not a few, and ſuch as were poore and deſpicable, but even the richeſt, moſt potent and populous Nations, ſhould take no ſcorne to cleave unto the Church of the Iewes. Which alſo ſets forth the glory of this Conqueſt of the Nations unto the Faith, that it was not done by compact and fraudulent convention, they were many of divers Languages, and farre aſunder; nor yet by force and violence, becauſe they were mighty and ſtronge, able to have made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance <hi>[Shall come to ſeeke the Lord of hostes in Ieruſalem]</hi> Typically, becauſe at this time Gods Worſhip beeing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14708:67"/>only there, all Converts were to reſort thither <hi>[And to pray before the Lord]</hi> as before <hi>Verſe</hi> 21. <hi>Verſe</hi> 22.</item>
                  <item>3. The Manner of their Converſion: which is ſo deſcribed, as the Iew, who thought himſelfe the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, and choyce Favourite of God, ſhould not thinke himſelfe diſparaged, and his glory eclypſed by the Acceſſe of the Gentiles into the Communion of the Church, but rather honoured thereby. Becauſe he ſhould be made the moſt honourable inſtrument of the others ſalvation. <hi>[Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, In thoſe dayes]</hi> of the publication of the Goſpel <hi>[it ſhall come to paſſe that ten men]</hi>

For it is manifeſt, that the Goſpel was preached, as firſt to the Iewes, ſo next by the Iewes to the Gentiles. Now it is alſo apparant, how the Gentiles flocked unto the Apoſtles, and other Iewes that brought them the glad tidings of Peace; how they honoured, and dearely eſteemed of them, &amp;c. Pauls entertainment may be an Example of all the reſt. <hi>[Saying, We will goe with you]</hi> in the worſhip and ſervice of the true God. The Reaſon of all this Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour given to the Iew, and of the Gentile's joyning himſelfe to him, is, <hi>[For wee have heard] viz.</hi> by your preaching, <hi>[that God is with you]</hi> only rightly knowne and worſhipped among you Iewes, or in the Church; but not among us who are ignorant idolatrous Gentiles. <hi>Verſe</hi> 23.</item>

Shall we then take it in this ſenſe, That the Iewes, now freed from Captivitie, ſhould bee no more under the government of forraine Princes, oppreſſing them with Tributes and Exactions? If wee conſider the Story of times ſucceeding the Captivitie, it is apparant, that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14708:75"/>the Iewes, though freed from Captivitie, yet were not freed from their Subjection to the Monarchs of Perſia, as long as they ſtood. They payd Toll and Tribute, as their Subjects; though yet herein was ſome part of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that as they uſed their owne Lawes, ſo they were governed by men of their owne Nation, as Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and the High Prieſts after them, not by Perſian Satrapaes, ſent thither for that purpoſe. Vpon the diſſolution of that Monarchie, the Iewes ran the ſame Fortune that other ſmaller Provinces did, being ſhared among the Succeſſors of Alexander. And though at that time they (no doubt) might well have afforded to attempt a revolt, and free themſelves, as haply ſome other Provinces did at the overthrow of the Perſian State, and deſtruction of the Graecian Empire after Alexanders death: yet beeing a weake and ſmall Territorie, impovereſhed and broken by their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and alſo lying in the mid-way betweene two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Kingdomes of Egypt and Syria, they were driven to put themſelves into the Protection of one of them. And yet they were ſafe on neither ſide, by reaſon of the hot Warres betweene thoſe Northerne and Southerne Kings; and ſo if they held with one ſide, they were judged Enemies on the other. Whence it came to paſſe, that they were put to continuall vexation, their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey much harried, the Citie often ſeazed on by force or feare, the Temple ſometime polluted, many Maſſacres committed upon the Inhabitants, Idolatry ſometimes eſtabliſhed by force, Tribute impoſed upon the Country, with other Miſeries, during moſt part of the time that theſe Syrian and Aegyptian Kings reigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14708:75"/>Deputies, not by the Naturals of the Countrey, who, till that time, were chiefe Rulers of the Iewiſh Affaires, though with ſome reference and ſubordination to one forraine Prince or other, for the moſt part. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo they defended themſelves as a free State, fought againſt their Enemies, over-came them, and alſo much enlarged their State and Territories. Wherefore I take it, that ſuch a kinde of Oppreſſour is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as the Iewes had formerly felt; namely, who ſhould utterly ruinate the Countrey, and carry away the People captive, as the Aſſyrians had done. And ſuch a one ſhould paſſe thorough them <hi>[no more] i. e.</hi> not a long time, or, with condition, ſo long as they were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to God: for ſo that Phraſe is often to be taken in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now this is true, that though the Iewes State had many ſore plunges, yet it held up its head, was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and flouriſhed, even among ſo many afflictions; and for the ſpace of almoſt five hundred yeares, till a few yeares before the comming of Chriſt, had Lawes and Governours of its owne, and was, in a manner, a free State, though in dependance upon others. And therefore when the Romanes had ſwallowed Syria and Egypt, yet they yeelded not, but upon conqueſt: And after Chriſts time thought themſelves ſtrong enough to rebell, which wrought their finall Ruine. If this bee not the meaning, I know not what to ſay of it; it were a labour worth the undertaking, to compile a ſhort Hiſtory of the times from the Captivitie to Chriſt, comparing the paſſages of Story with the Prophecies: It would give much light, eſpecially to the three laſt of the ſmaller Prophets. Story is yet very defective in this particular.</p>

This lowly Mind and meane Eſtate of the Meſſias, as it appeared through
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14708:77"/>the whole courſe of his life, from his birth to his death; ſo was it then very remarkeable, when, above all other times, hee ſeemed to take greateſt State upon him, namely, when hee made his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Entrance into his Citie of Ieruſalem; which is here fore-ſhewen unto Zacharie by the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Spirit. For, albeit at that time the Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Honour the People gave unto him, as unto a King, were not ſmall: yet, in regard of outward Magnificence, they were farre inferiour to the Pompe and Statelineſſe, which earthly Potentates make at their Entries into the head Cities of their Kingdomes. The Manner of his Entrance, in all humble and lowly ſort, is ſet forth by one ſpeciall Circumſtance of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the kinde of Beaſt that hee ſhould ride upon, <hi>[And riding upon an Aſſe]</hi> not carried in a Triumphall Chariot, or on ſome ſtately Courſer, or on a Mule, as the faſhion of Kings,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Reg. 1.33.</note> before and then, was, eſpecially in greater Solemnities: but on an Aſſe, a poore ſilly Beaſt. Tis true, that the riding on an Aſſe was a Cuſtome not diſhonourable, but uſed even by ſuch as were Princes and great Men; as <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.10. [Speake yee that ride on white Aſſes, yee that ſit in judgement, &amp;c.] And the thirty Sonnes of Iair, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10.4. with the forty Sonnes and thirty Nephewes of Abdon, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 12.14. are ſaid to ride upon ſo many Aſſe-Colts: likewiſe 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.23. of Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel, a great Counſellour of State; and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.26. of Mephiboſheth, a Kings Sonne: yet I ſuppoſe it to bee probable, that at this time that old Cuſtome was almoſt worne out: And though mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner men did uſe the Aſſe, both for Travell and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; yet that the Princes and Kings of the Iewes for a long time, eſpecially ſuch as they had after the Captivitie, did imitate the Cuſtomes of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and uſed the more comely and gracefull

No, the Chariot, the Horſe, the Bow, all Earthly Weapons ſhould have no force to preſerve and enlarge Chriſts ſpirituall Empire over mens hearts and conſciences. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.4. <hi>Micah</hi> 5.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. Further, this may imply, that as outward Force cannot helpe forward, ſo it ſhall not hinder the Kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
